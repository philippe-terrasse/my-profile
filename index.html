				<h1> Hey there! Welcome to my profile. </h1>
				<img class="img-circle" src="images/pp.jpg" alt="Philippe photo" id=img-perso>
				<p> My name is Philippe Terrasse. Born and raised in Caracas, Venezuela inside a French family, I moved to Paris in 2017 for my undergraduate studies. After two years of preparatory class at Intégrale Prépa, I passed the competitive exam mandatory for admission at French business schools (Grandes Écoles), and was admitted to HEC Paris. I am currently based in Jouy-en-Josas, where the HEC Paris campus is located.

				<h2> Academics </h2>
				<p>In 2017 I obtained the French Baccalauréat (High School diploma) with an average of 17.42/20, and also passed several American tests such as the SAT (1530/1600) and the TOEFL (113/120). In 2020 I was admitted to HEC Paris, ranked 178th in France. I am particularly interested in public speaking, and have participated in multiple debate programs over the years at different levels.

				<h2>Interests</h2>
				<p>For my career, I am leaning towards entrepreneurship but am still undecided, and would like to have internships in consulting and diplomacy before making up my mind. For leisure, I enjoy practicing several sports, notably soccer (over 10 years), tennis (3 years), and kitesurfing (3 years).
